Using find()
Time(s): 2.686s, 2.685s, 2.689s

Using binary_search()
Time(s): 2.685s, 2.686s, 2.693s

Using bitset Vector
Time(s): 5.111s, 5.111s, 5,106s

Load Factor
numPrimes = 148933
numTotal = 2000000

numPrimes/numTotal = 7.45%

Using map
Time(s): 3.383s, 3.382s, 3.384s

With my implementation using a map is actually slower than using find() or binary_search().
