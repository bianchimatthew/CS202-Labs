This program reads a "map" on standard input. It's really a text file in the following format:
A period stands for dirt
A dash stands for a rock with nothing under it
An upper case letter stands for rock with gold hidden under it. The amount of gold represented by the letter: A stands for one ounce, B stands for two ounces, etc.
There are no other characters on the map.
For example, the following map in map1.txt contains a lot of dirt, but it also contains one rock with nothing under it, and three rocks with gold: one ounce (A), three ounces (C) and 26 ounces (Z).

.........A.....
..Z.........C..
Your job is to write a program called gold.cpp, which reads a map on standard input and prints the total ounces of gold on the map.
